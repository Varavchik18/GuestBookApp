This is the test task where I implemented simple functionality in different ways in order to show my knowledge.
DB: ms sql
ORM: EF core (with migrations)
Backend: dotnet 7
Frontend: vue (quasar) 


Here is the requirements of a task:

Implement the guestbook/comments functionality. 
1) Create a simple form for adding and displaying comments using vue.js
a.  It should be possible to add comments
b.  Data validation (length, availability of entered data)
c. It is advisable not to take a ready-made template and design it yourself 
2) Create a set of controllers and methods on the back-end side. For the back-end, you need to use asp.net core c#
a. There should be at least one controller - which will have two methods for adding comments and displaying the list. Again, it is desirable to do it in the form of some kind of object model not at the level of the laboratory where there is a controller and inside the method of full implementation
b.  Data should be stored in an mssql database, accessed using the entity framework core
c.  On the side of the method - adding comments - there should be validation for mandatory fields, as well as their length.
